Welcome to the new look anglebrackets website.

This project has been on my TO-DO list for far too long, but I've finally managed to get this one ticked off the list and I'm quite pleased with how it's turned out. I'm currently back filling my blog posts, portfolios and books into this new site and hope to get this done over the coming weeks.

One of the new sections we are offering is Angular certification, getting an Angular certification will help you progress in your career, use it as a reference when applying for developer roles and to validate your expertise in the Angular ecosystem. Head on over to the <a href="https://anglebrackets.dev/certifications">Certifications</a> section and take your first step to that next level.

I've lots planned for this site and welcome input from the [Angular/Angular Material] community on what you would like to see here. If you would like to write a blog post to be published on anglebrackets.dev then get in touch and we'll try and make that happen.

Looking forward to connecting with you all.
